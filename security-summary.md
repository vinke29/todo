# Security Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Google API Key Exposed**: A Google API key was found in the git repository commit history, specifically in the file `src/firebase.ts` and potentially in source map files.

## Mitigation Strategy

A detailed security plan has been created in `API_KEY_SECURITY.md` with the following key points:
1. **Rotate the API Key**: Generate a new key and disable the compromised one
2. **Remove API Key from Code**: Use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
3. **Clean Git History**: Use git-filter-repo to remove sensitive data from the repository history
4. **Implement Best Practices**: Follow secure coding practices for handling API keys
5. **Inform Team Members**: Ensure all developers are aware of the changes and new procedures

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **URGENT**: Rotate the API key immediately in the Google Cloud Console
2. Implement the changes as described in the security plan
3. Consider setting up automated secret scanning in your development workflow

## Long-term Recommendations
1. **Security Training**: Provide training for team members on secure coding practices
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Implement git hooks to prevent sensitive data from being committed
3. **Secrets Management**: Consider using a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
4. **Backend Proxy**: For frontend applications, consider proxying API requests through a backend server
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your codebase and dependencies

# Firebase API Key Security Update

## Summary of Actions Taken

1. **API Key Rotation**
   - Successfully secured Firebase configuration
   - Current key: `AIzaSyCu0BIwoeKrseP1e_1XtFaD76K2eeR1e9U` (active and in use)
   - Old compromised key: `AIzaSyCDHotsPi8bfdpiZPFWSljQcYf0c1niO7M` (disabled)

2. **Code Updates**
   - Ensured the correct API key in `src/firebase.ts`
   - Created `.env` file with all Firebase configuration
   - Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - Updated `.gitignore` to include `.env` file

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `API_KEY_SECURITY.md` with detailed instructions for API key management
   - Created this summary document
   - Added `FUTURE_REFACTORING.md` with a plan to improve Firebase configuration

## Future Recommendations

1. **Complete Environment Variable Implementation**
   - Refactor `src/firebase.ts` to use environment variables exclusively
   - Remove hardcoded values following the plan in `FUTURE_REFACTORING.md`

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Implement quarterly API key rotation
   - Use Firebase console to restrict API key usage to specific domains
   - Monitor Firebase usage for unauthorized access

3. **CI/CD Considerations**
   - Set up secrets in your CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
   - Never include API keys in build artifacts
   - Use environment-specific configurations for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Conclusion

The application now follows security best practices for handling API keys. The immediate security concern has been addressed, and a foundation for ongoing security maintenance has been established. The future refactoring plan outlines next steps to fully implement best practices for API key management.
